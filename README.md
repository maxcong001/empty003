## Welcome to My place

this repository is for a new thinking in the encode/decode message between IOT "gateway" and IOT terminal.

the final design is to make it out as an IP(via FPGA or else) and there is a sofware version too.

why? now the IOT device face secority issue. IOT device is low power consumption and have limit computing power. that is a challenge to encript/decrypt the message for IOT device.

will use BPNN
